      <description>For the last 8 weeks I have been taking the Code First Girls Spring 2018 Python course, hosted by IG. This is a free course for women who are students or recent graduates with the aim to encourage more women to get into programming and tech careers. These courses are hosted all over the UK, sponsored by various companies and universities.
There are currently 3 different courses you can do: Beginner front-end programming, intermediate Python and intermediate Ruby.</description>
