      <description>Interactive Visualisations in R  This post was inspired by this competition, hosted by JumpingRivers. The competition asks you to extract data from their GitHub account containing the details of R groups and R ladies groups around the world. With this data it asks you to create a visualisation, of any kind. Iâ€™ve been working on my visualisation skills in R so I thought I would have a go at entering.</description>

You download a map of your chosen location from google maps and use it as a layer in the ggplot2 plotting system.</description>
